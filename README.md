# **300 days of ML and Deep Learning**
**Day 1 of 300**
+ *Intro to ML, types of machine learning*: Today I got familiar with machine learning and its applications to some real world scenarios. Additionally, I got a bird's-eye view on the types of ML systems - supervised and unsupervised systems. Supervised refers to such ML systems where labels-or, desired solutions- for data sets are fed to the system whereas the latter is fed without labels. Furthermore, I learned about some terms like attributes, features, regression, clustering, and visualization.

**Day 2 of 300**
+ **More types of ML systems and challenges of ML**: I got a decent introduction to other types of ML systems such as Instance Based versus Model Based Learning, Batch versus Online Learning along with some examples. I developed some familiarity with terms like utility/fitness function, cost function, hyperparameter, sampling bias, outliers, feature selection and extraction. Likewise, I came to know about problems for ML systems such as overfitting, underfitting, data mismatch etc. I am not diving into mathematics behind everything but getting a considerable understanding of concepts. Still no code whatsoever.

**Day 3 of 300**
+ **Beginning a ML project**: I got started with the chapter-2 of the book which is about a ML project from start to finish. I was introduced to some checklists to be marked when creating a ML system like selecting a performance measure. Nothing special just wrote some code and made chatGPT explain it. I hope to understand it all real soon.

**Day 4 of 300**
+ **An Introduction to numpy**: Today, I realized that I need to have some level of familiarity with numpy and pandas to further proceed with the "ML" book. So, I typed some code in numpy, learned some stuffs about ndarray, ndtype, basic operations, dimensions in ndarray, etc. Numpy uses "contiguous memory" that makes its operations faster than python.

 **Day 5 of 300**
 + **Further numpy**: Today, I learned about array slicing, copying them deeply such that the original does not mutate, slicing to lower dimesnions, about how the axes work in numpy.

 **Day 6 of 300**
 + **Pseudorandom number generation, universal functions, fancy indexing**: Today, I learned indexing arrays with integer arrays, generating same "random" numbers throughtout the program, and about element-wise array operations i.e vectorization of operations.

 **Day 7 of 300**
 + **Completed chapter 4 from the book**: I got a decent introduction to array-oriented programming in numpy and used some mathematical methods. I learned about np.unique functions and its comparsion to sorted in python plus read and write numpy arrays to files.

 **Day 8 of 300**
 + **Introduction to pandas**: I got started with the fifth chapter to the mentioned book to initiate pandas. At a surface level, I got understanding of pandas series, dataframes, some possible data inputs to DF constructor, changing and labeling columns,etc.

 **Day 9 of 300**
 + **Further pandas**: Today, I learnt about reindexing, 
 dropping entries from an axis, selection and filtering.

  **Day 10 of 300**
 + **Further pandas**: I got introduced to data alignment in pandas, filling values when axis label is found for one obj but not another, using numpy ufuncs to work with pandas object, sorting and ranking...

  **Day 11 of 300**
 + **Using some numpy and pandas function**:  Today, I was able to see application of numpy and pandas in Machine Learning code like the random number generator's seed value, numpy permutation shuffling, etc. I learned to create test set and train set from data, read histogram properly with correct scaling and use sklearn to make some work easier to do.
