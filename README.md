# **300 days of ML and Deep Learning**
**Day 1 of 300**
+ *Intro to ML, types of machine learning*: Today I got familiar with machine learning and its applications to some real world scenarios. Additionally, I got a bird's-eye view on the types of ML systems - supervised and unsupervised systems. Supervised refers to such ML systems where labels-or, desired solutions- for data sets are fed to the system whereas the latter is fed without labels. Furthermore, I learned about some terms like attributes, features, regression, clustering, and visualization.

  + **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**
  + **ChatGPT**
  
**Day 2 of 300**
+ **More types of ML systems and challenges of ML**: I got a decent introduction to other types of ML systems such as Instance Based versus Model Based Learning, Batch versus Online Learning along with some examples. I developed some familiarity with terms like utility/fitness function, cost function, hyperparameter, sampling bias, outliers, feature selection and extraction. Likewise, I came to know about problems for ML systems such as overfitting, underfitting, data mismatch etc. I am not diving into mathematics behind everything but getting a considerable understanding of concepts. Still no code whatsoever.

**Day 3 of 300**
+ **Beginning a ML project**: I got started with the chapter-2 of the book which is about a ML project from start to finish. I was introduced to some checklists to be marked when creating a ML system like selecting a performance measure. Nothing special just wrote some code and made chatGPT explain it. I hope to understand it all real soon.

**Day 4 of 300**
+ **An Introduction to numpy**: Today, I realized that I need to have some level of familiarity with numpy and pandas to further proceed with the "ML" book. So, I typed some code in numpy, learned some stuffs about ndarray, ndtype, basic operations, dimensions in ndarray, etc. Numpy uses "contiguous memory" that makes its operations faster than python.
