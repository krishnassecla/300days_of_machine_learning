# **300 days of ML and Deep Learning**
**Day 1 of 300**
+ *Intro to ML, types of machine learning*: Today I got familiar with machine learning and its applications to some real world scenarios. Additionally, I got a bird's-eye view on the types of ML systems - supervised and unsupervised systems. Supervised refers to such ML systems where labels-or, desired solutions- for data sets are fed to the system whereas the latter is fed without labels. Furthermore, I learned about some terms like attributes, features, regression, clustering, and visualization.

**Day 2 of 300**
+ **More types of ML systems and challenges of ML**: I got a decent introduction to other types of ML systems such as Instance Based versus Model Based Learning, Batch versus Online Learning along with some examples. I developed some familiarity with terms like utility/fitness function, cost function, hyperparameter, sampling bias, outliers, feature selection and extraction. Likewise, I came to know about problems for ML systems such as overfitting, underfitting, data mismatch etc. I am not diving into mathematics behind everything but getting a considerable understanding of concepts. Still no code whatsoever.
