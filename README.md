# **300 days of ML and Deep Learning**
**Day 1 of 300**
+ *Intro to ML, types of machine learning**: Today I got familiar with machine learning and its applications to some real world scenarios. Additionally, I got a bird's-eye view on the types of ML systems - supervised and unsupervised systems. Supervised refers to such ML systems where labels-or, desired solutions- for data sets are fed to the system whereas the latter is fed without labels. Furthermore, I learned about some terms like attributes, features, regression, clustering, and visualization.
